# Banking System
## About
This is a team based project for CS157A (Intro to DBMS) that utilizes MySQL as the DBMS, Java as the front-end, and JDBC as the connector in order to emulate a basic banking system based on the dataset provided below:

## Setup
This project uses Maven in order to inject our JDBC dependencies, so and IDE that allows for Maven projects (i.e: Eclipse) is preferred.

A sample config.json file is provided, and contains the credentials needed to connect MySQL locally. By default, the root account is used, but the username and password can be changed to an existing MySQL user if you would like to avoid such.
